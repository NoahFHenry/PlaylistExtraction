# PlaylistExtraction
Python and bash script for extracting track IDs from given Spotify playlist and returning the audio features.

There are countless ways of doing this, but I like to separate the steps when working on a small scale. First, grab the track IDs from a given playlist using the python script. You can then copy these into the bash script and run an array of tracks simultanesouly. You can run this on a local terminal and save the output as JSON, for example, from which you can then just copy into a csv file and voil√†!
